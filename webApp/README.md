Purpose:

This project is an application of how a web server handles http requests from clients. This project intends to provide administrator a flexible way to manage a database from another end-system to provide version control support for files.

Description:

Upon connecting to http://ip_address:8080/Real/login.html, the user is then required to enter credentials for authentication. The user is then authenticated by the server authentication scheme. Upon successful authentication, the server allows the user to access index.html. Inside index.html, the authenticated user can choose to drag and drop files to the server, or upload the files using the traditional file upload feature in html. If the files uploaded are of .csv format, the user can then insert these files into the database with the table names being the names of the .csv files. The user can then check, add or delete the data in the database by typing "check", "add" or "delete" in the text field beside the "Send" button through the use of JPA and Restful API.

The web application can be added new functionalities to support machine learning concepts regarding to analysing the data. Moreover, the view of the webpages will be modified to work with new front-end development framework.

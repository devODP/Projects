Purpose:
This project is an application of how a web server handles http requests from clients. This project intends to provide administrator a flexible way
to manage a database (derby) using an html file from another end-system and provide version control support for files.

Description:
Upon connecting to the web server, the user will be linked to the default home page login.html. The user is then required to enter credentials for authentication.
On the server side, the servlet "Login" is designed to handle the authentication from the user. Upon successful authentication, the servlet "login" will allow the 
user to retrieve data from database in the client.html, and upload files to the host machine in login.html. and the user can then enter SQL commands to retrieve or 
modify entries in the database.
